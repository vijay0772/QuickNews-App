# CS 442 MP5: Final Project

## 1. Overview

This last machine problem in the class is an open-ended one. You will be building a mobile application of your choice using the Flutter framework. You are free to choose any application domain you like, but your application must meet the requirements described below.

## 2. Requirements

Your application must meet the following high-level requirements:

1. There should be at least 3 separate screens/pages in your application, each of which should be implemented as a separate widget. One of these pages should be the default "home" page that is displayed when the application is first launched. Navigation between pages can be implemented using any of the standard Flutter mechanisms (e.g., `Navigator`, `TabBar`, `BottomNavigationBar`, etc.).
2. At least one of the pages in your application should be backed by a stateful widget, which in turn should be backed by a custom model class. The model class should encapsulate the data that is displayed/manipulated on the page. You may choose to use any of the mechanisms we discussed in class (e.g., `setState`, `ChangeNotifier`, `Provider`, etc.) to update the UI on model object updates.
3. Your app should persist some user-updateable data across application launches in some way. You can use any of the mechanisms we discussed for doing so (e.g., `SharedPreferences`, `sqflite`, etc.).
4. Your app should access some data from an external source (e.g., a RESTful API or a cloud database like Cloud Firestore) and display it in some way. You may use the `http` package, or other third-party packages, to do so. The accessed data should be dynamic in some way (i.e., it should change over time, whether in response to user input or external events).
5. Your app should include unit, widget, and integration tests.

### 2.1 Implementation details

Becaause of the open-ended nature of this machine problem, we will not be providing any starter code. You are free to use any of the code we went over in class as a starting point, but you are not required to do so. All code you submit should be your own.

Though you may use third-party libraries (as described in the next section), the main business logic of your application should be written by you and not outsourced. You should not use any code that you find online or in other sources.

### 2.2 External packages

We have included the following packages in the `pubspec.yaml` file:

- [`collection`](https://pub.dev/packages/collection): a library that provides a set of additional data structures and utilities
- [`flutter_test`](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_test): a library that provides a set of utilities for writing widget tests
- [`http`](https://pub.dev/packages/http): a library that provides a set of high-level asynchronous functions for communicating with HTTP servers
- [`integration_test`](https://pub.dev/packages/integration_test): a library that provides a set of utilities for writing integration tests
- [`mockito`](https://pub.dev/packages/mockito): a library that provides a set of utilities for mocking classes and objects
- [`path`](https://pub.dev/packages/path): a library that provides a set of utilities for manipulating paths
- [`path_provider`](https://pub.dev/packages/path_provider): a library that provides a set of utilities for locating files/directories on the filesystem
- [`provider`](https://pub.dev/packages/provider): a library that provides a set of utilities for managing and disseminating stateful data
- [`shared_preferences`](https://pub.dev/packages/shared_preferences): a library that provides a persistent store for simple data
- [`sqflite`](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite): a library that wraps SQLite functionality for use in Flutter applications
- [`test`](https://pub.dev/packages/test): a library that provides a set of utilities for writing unit tests

For this machine problem, you may also make use of other third-party packages found on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev/), provided you request approval in advance.

## 3. Sample projects

Here are some ideas for projects that satisfy the requirements above:

1. Weather: an app that displays the weather forecast for one or more "favorite" locations, which can be persisted. The weather data should be retrieved from a weather API (e.g., [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api)).

2. GitHub repository browser: an app that allows the user to browse GitHub repositories and view some of their details. The repository data should be retrieved from the [GitHub REST API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest). A list of favorite repositories can be persisted.

3. News reader: an app that allows the user to search for and browse news articles from a news API (e.g., [NewsAPI](https://newsapi.org/)). Previous searches and bookmarked/read articles can be persisted.

4. Task manager: an app that allows the user to create and manage tasks and/or subtasks persisted in a cloud database. Some form of user identification/authentication (for collaboration) may be implemented.

## 4. Testing

We will be testing your application by building and running it as either a native macOS, Android, or iOS app. Your app should run without errors or warnings.

You should include at least 5 distinct unit tests that focus on testing the functionality of your model classes. You should include at least 5 distinct widget tests that focus on testing the functionality of your custom widgets.
You should include at least one integration test group that demonstrates the correctness of some core feature(s) of your app.

## 5. Grading

This machine problem is worth 50 points. Your grade will be based on the following criteria:

- 10 points: there should be at least 3 separate screens/pages in your application, each of which should be implemented as a separate widget, and can be reach either as the "home" page or via some form of navigation.
- 10 points: at least one of the pages in your application should be backed by a stateful widget, which in turn should be backed by a custom model class, which makes use of some form of state management.
- 10 points: some user-updateable data is correctly persisted across application launches (either locally or in the cloud).
- 10 points: some data is dynamically accessed from an external source (e.g., a RESTful or cloud-based API) and displayed it in some way.
- 10 points: the requisite number of unit, widget, and integration tests are included, and they pass.

If your code does not compile, you will receive a zero for the assignment. If your code compiles but does not meet the requirements, you will receive partial credit based on the extent to which it does.

## 6. Submission

To submit your machine problem, commit and push your code to the "main" branch in your private GitHub repository shared with us. You can make as many commits and pushes as needed; we will assess the most recent version of your code pushed before the deadline.

Note that you may NOT apply late days to this machine problem. If you do not submit your code before the deadline, you will receive a zero for the assignment.
